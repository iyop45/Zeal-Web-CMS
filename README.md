# Zeal web development project

## Summary
Zeal is a web development project to allow clients to create fully database driven websites without having any back end code on their web host. This is done through a javascript framework that authenticates a websites request to access, modify and delete different aspects of the their website to enable dynamic webpages.

At the moment, this project is in its very early stages and is a mere proof of concept. I may take this project in a different direction as I see fit.

The project is written with the [Symfony2](https://symfony.com/) framework and has made extensive use of their FOS bundles to speed up development.
